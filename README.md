Python Basics

Python is a high-level programming language that is used everywhere. It is currently the most popular programming language and is commonly used in data science as well as many other places that we would not expect.
Python has a huge set of libraries that is helpful to quickly do many things. Many informatics systems already support Python, before any installation.
Here are a few simple short programming examples of Python code that I created in response to recent requests. Please note that these were created and tested working in a very short time.


1.	A simle Python code that will take two sides of a right triangle and calculate the longest side - hypotenuse. (Pythagorean theorem:)

Here is another variation:

2.	A simple converter that will convert miles or kilometres to their counterparts as required.
